# How does CoinHub Wallet work?

- CoinHub Wallet is like a browser for blockchains. Via CoinHub wallet you can interact with blockchains, see your balance of funds stored on blockchain.
- No crypto is stored on CoinHub Wallet itself. That's not how it works. All the funds are stored on blockchain. CoinHub gives you access to them.
- CoinHub Wallet is free to download and does not earn anything when you use it.Â Fees are all paid to the miners or validators of crypto networks.
- CoinHub Wallet helps you interact with blockchain, in order to send and receive cryptos.
